Lab Experiment – 16: Building an AI Agent using Prompt Builder and Agentforce
AIM:
To design and configure an intelligent AI Agent using Prompt Builder that leverages LLMs and CRM data through Agentforce.
OBJECTIVE:
1.	To understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with CRM data.
2.	To build a Prompt in Prompt Builder for a specific business use case.
3.	To integrate the Prompt into an Autonomous Agent using Agentforce Builder.
4.	To observe how the agent performs reasoning and retrieves CRM data dynamically.
THEORY:
Large Language Models (LLMs) form the backbone of generative AI applications by understanding and generating human-like responses.
In Salesforce, Data + AI + CRM integration allows LLMs to interact securely with customer data, enabling more personalized and context-aware answers.
The Prompt Builder tool is used to design structured prompts that define how the LLM should behave and respond.
Agentforce extends this by enabling the creation of Autonomous Agents that can perform tasks, interact with CRM records, and automate workflows.
By combining Prompt Fundamentals and Agentforce Builder, developers can create intelligent AI-driven assistants tailored for specific CRM operations.
PROCEDURE:
1.	Login to Salesforce Setup:
o	Navigate to Agentforce Setup under AI Cloud.
2.	Create a New Prompt in Prompt Builder:
o	Open Prompt Builder.
o	Click New Prompt Template.
o	Enter Prompt Name: CustomerInsightPrompt.
o	Define the input variable: Customer_ID.
o	In the prompt text, enter:
“Retrieve key details and latest opportunities for the customer with ID: {!Customer_ID}.”
o	Save and Test Prompt with a sample customer ID.
3.	Build the Agent using Agentforce Builder:
o	Go to Agentforce Builder.
o	Click New Agent → Name it CRM Insight Agent.
o	Assign the previously created Prompt Template (CustomerInsightPrompt).
o	Configure the Data Access Scope (e.g., Accounts, Opportunities).
o	Set Agent Type: Autonomous Agent.
4.	Enable the Agent:
o	Activate the agent and deploy it to a test environment or sandbox.
5.	Test the Agent:
o	Query the agent with a customer ID (e.g., “Get insights for Customer ID 1001”).
o	Observe the LLM response integrating CRM data dynamically.
OBSERVATION:
Test Input	Prompt Executed	Agent Response	Observation
Customer ID: 1001	Retrieve key details and latest opportunities	“Customer 1001 – John Doe has 3 open opportunities worth ₹5,00,000.”	The LLM used CRM data and generated contextual insights successfully.
RESULT:
The CRM Insight Agent was successfully created and integrated with Prompt Builder using Agentforce.
The experiment demonstrates how LLMs, CRM data, and Prompt Engineering can be combined to create Autonomous Agents capable of contextual reasoning and intelligent automation.
